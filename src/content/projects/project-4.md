## Project Overview

Website app for a discord bot to elevate server engagement with Would You, featuring user voting, daily messages, and customizability. I was mainly involved in building the question pack features which allows users to create custom question packs for the bot on their server.

## Objectives

1. Develop the question pack pages and forms based on the figma design.

2. Handle and valudate user input for the question pack forms.

3. Submit the question pack data to the backend for storage.

## Technology Stack

- [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org): For its fullstack and SSG capabilities.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com): For styling the site.
- [Prisma ORM](https://drizzle.team): Typescript ORM to communicate with MongoDB.
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/): For animations and transitions.
- [Discord OAuth](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api): Googles ai model used for OG description generation.

## Outcome

The features will be live on the site soon you can check it out [here](https://wouldyoubot.gg).
