# Website

My portfolio website built with Astro, TailwindCSS and MDX

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside the project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ icons/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ some-icon.svg
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ all-other-components.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/ 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ projects/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.
